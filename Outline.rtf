Welcome to 
\f2\i Talk OCD
\f1\i0 , a youth-led initiative under the HOSA Mental Health Promotion program. Our goal is to educate the public about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and foster understanding through compassion, factual information, and open dialogue. We strive to create a community where individuals feel informed, supported, and empowered to discuss mental health without judgment.\
\

\f0\b 2. About Us
\f1\b0 \
\

\f0\b Who We Are
\f1\b0 \
We are a group of students from Bishop P. F. Reding Catholic Secondary School dedicated to promoting mental health awareness. As members of our school\'92s HOSA chapter, we focus on providing reliable, evidence-based information and encouraging open discussions about OCD among youth and the broader community.\

\f0\b \
Why We Chose OCD
\f1\b0 \
OCD is frequently misunderstood, often misrepresented in media and casual conversation. Misconceptions can create barriers to seeking help and support, especially for young people. We chose to focus on OCD to challenge stereotypes, raise awareness, and highlight the real impact this disorder can have on youth.\
\

\f0\b Our Mission
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0
\cf0 	\'95	To educate the public with accurate and accessible information about OCD\
	\'95	To reduce stigma and misconceptions surrounding the disorder\
	\'95	To support youth mental health conversations in schools and communities\
	\'95	To empower individuals to understand OCD beyond stereotypes\

\

\f0\b 4. The Reality of Living With OCD
\f1\b0 \
\

\f0\b Emotional Impact

\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0
\cf0 	\'95	Anxiety\
	\'95	Stress\
	\'95	Guilt\
	\'95	Fear\
	\'95	Exhaustion\
\
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf0 Daily Challenges

\cf0 	\'95	Spending excessive time on compulsions\

\f0\b \cf0 The OCD Cycle
\f1\b0 \
OCD operates as a continuous cycle:\
\

\f0\b Obsessive Thought \uc0\u8594  Anxiety \u8594  Compulsion \u8594  Temporary Relief \u8594  Obsessive Thought Again
\f1\b0 \
\

\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf0 5. Ending the Stigma
\f1\b0 \
\

\f0\b Why Stigma Matters
\f1\b0 \
Misusing the term \'93OCD\'94 in casual conversation can lead to misunderstanding and minimize the struggles of those living with the disorder. Stereotypes and jokes may discourage individuals from seeking help or talking openly about their experiences.\
\

\f0\b Language Matters
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0
\cf0 	\'95	Avoid: \'93I\'92m so OCD.\'94 \uc0\u8594  Instead: \'93I prefer things to be organized.\'94\
	\'95	Avoid: \'93Just stop thinking about it.\'94 \uc0\u8594  Instead: \'93I\'92m here if you want to talk.\'94\
\
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf0 How We Can Create Change
\f1\b0 \
\pard\pardeftab560\slleading20\partightenfactor0
\cf0 	\'95	Use respectful and informed language\
	\'95	Listen to real experiences of individuals with OCD\
	\'95	Stay educated about mental health\
	\'95	Choose words intentionally to promote understanding and empathy\
